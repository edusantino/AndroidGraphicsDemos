This repository contains various shaders and tech demos created using GLSL, Canvas, and other graphical technologies. I will keep it updated over time.

Stack:
- Android: The core platform for developing and running the demos.
- Kotlin: The primary programming language used for development.
- Koin: For dependency injection in the project.

Technologies:
- OpenGL ES: For rendering advanced 3D graphics.
- SurfaceView: For integrating OpenGL within the Android UI.
- Canvas: For drawing 2D graphics and custom views.
- GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language): For writing shaders and performing advanced graphical computations.
- Android SDK: The development kit for Android, including tools, APIs, and libraries.
